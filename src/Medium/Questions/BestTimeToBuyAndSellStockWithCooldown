Problem Description
Given an array of integers A of size N in which ith element is the price of the stock on day i,

You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

-> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e. you must sell the stock before you buy again).
-> After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (i.e. cooldown 1 day)

Find the maximum profit you can achieve.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 50000
0 <= A[i] <= 10^6


Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.


Output Format
Return the maximum profit you can achieve.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]


Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 3, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:
3

Output 2:
2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 2 (price = 2), profit = 1
cooldown on day 3
Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 5 (price = 2) profit = 2
Total profit = 3.

Explanation 2:

Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 3), profit = 2
Total Profit = 2

Given a string A consisting of lowercase English alphabets. Your task is to find how many substrings of A are palindrome.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even if they consist of same characters.

Return the count of palindromic substrings.

Note: A string is palindrome if it reads the same from backward and forward.


Input Format

The only argument given is string A.
Output Format

Return the count of palindromic substrings.
Constraints

1 <= length of the array <= 1000
For Example

Input 1:
    A = "abab"
Output 1:
    6
Explanation 1:
    6 palindromic substrings are:
    "a", "aba", "b", "bab", "a" and "b".

Input 2:
    A = "ababa"
Output 2:
    9
Explanation 9:
    9 palindromic substrings are:
    "a", "a", "a", "b", "b" , "aba" ,"bab", "aba" and "ababa".
